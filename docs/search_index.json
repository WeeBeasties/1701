This system uses a series of five-value, four-point rubrics to evaluate student achievement. The rubrics were derived from the VALUE rubrics from the American Association of Colleges and Universities. Formulae have also been developed to convert assignment scores or standardized exam percentiles to a similar rubric scale. This will allow easier comparisons of student performances across the program, regardless of the assessment instrument used to evaluate their work. Finally, score thresholds have been defined for aggregate student scores. These criteria of success were selected based upon modeled score distributions. This report is meant to provide an opportunity for anyone to comment upon, suggest changes to, or otherwise improve this scoring system. Report number 1701, DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/6KFDV↩ "],
